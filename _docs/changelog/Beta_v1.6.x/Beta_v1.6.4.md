# Beta_v1.6.4
Tweaked the AI Entrancement frequency to be less frequent
Now when an Entrancer dies, all of the characters that were entranced by them lose the trait
Fixed MAA icons not showing up in some tooltips and gui windows
Aeluran Order and Advanced Tribal government types have had their vassal contracts fixed. They should give Gold and taxes and everything else again.
Loads of minor localization and icon fixes

Reworked the magi reinforcement mechanic from the Aeluran Advisor's Magistration council task.
- Now will stay in one special soldier army instead of dozens of little separate special soldier armies
- Both quantity of magi received per Aeluran vassal and frequency of the magi being recruited have been increased.
- There is now a cap on the amount of Aeluran magi you can maintain at one time.
- The total cap can be increased by adopting stronger Aeluran Authority laws
- Now the full event will only pop up once when a new army is formed, following updates will just be notices in the message feed to help reduce event spam.

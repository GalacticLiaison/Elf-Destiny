temple holdings

"Great mod, I have one problem though, after converting to Aeluran Weavers my new Court Chaplain does not inherit my temple holdings and I cant grant them to her manually, so Im stuck with them and vastly over my domain limit... any way to fix this?"

"you select the county, grant to option, top left i think, should be grant to correct religion? i forget, one of the two should work though. otherwise im not sure"

"unfortunately not possible, as I said, I cant grant them manually, the button is greyed out and says something like "this holding cant be granted, it should be leased out to your realm priest..." if I hover over it with the mouse. Its like the game does not recognize the new realm priest; I tried to fix it by getting a new one, but no luck there."

"So I am having the same issue, with the changes to the Aeluran Weavers, I can't give my temple holdings to random vassals."

# Beta_v1.4.4 - Expedition Enhancements

Corrected Adventurer MAA cost reduction from 75% discount => 50% discount gold. This may still be too much and so will keep an eye on it!
AI will no longer move or complete portal when they meet the requirements. Maybe will re-enable one day when it makes sense.
Removed chinese localization files at the request of the folks supporting the chinese submod

Expeditons!
- Fixed Spark Crystal so that a player can not find one if they already have one!
- Added more items to the loot table!
    - NEW Elven Armors!
    - NEW Elven Brooch!
    - NEW Elven Boots!
    - NEW Elven Sword!
    - NEW Elven Hammer!
- Loot table Items will now also have a random "archetype" modifier added that gives a relevant bonus! This will help make each artifact found feel a bit more special! The archetypes are:
    - Ravager
    - Roadmen
    - Paladin
    - Captin
    - Noble
    - Aeluran
- Added NEW Lembas Satchel Epic Artifact! Found randomly on expeditions but should be quite rare!
- Trial Of Greed received a facelift!
    - This honestly barely worked before, fixed a dozen bugs with it.
    - The new elf loot can be found in this trial.
    - Now your party member with the highest stewardship stat will try to advise you on how much loot you can take before the trap is triggered! As always they can be wrong! The lower the stat the more likely they are wrong.

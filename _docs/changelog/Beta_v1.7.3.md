# Beta_v1.7.3

## Balance Tweaks
Álfar culture (Daelurin) has received a NEW variant of the "Tribes of the North" culture, replacing the Siberian Permafrost county penalty with a bonus
The Magi trait now gives +3 prowess

## Bug Fixes
Fixed the royal court scene being in the Shadow Realm on DX11
Baldness should once again be removed from the game
Tribal building should now be fixed with Advanced Tribal (Thanks Edgor12)
Characters being created with evolved personality and tier 4 genetic traits should be dramatically reduced, most of those that are created with them should have them swapped out every 5 years or so.

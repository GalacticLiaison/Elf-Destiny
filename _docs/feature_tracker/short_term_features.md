# Note, launch the "Help me pick expedition sites" thread. "And what are some ideas for elf ruins you would like to see there?" 

# Things to work on!
- give aeluran matriarch/matrons.sisters a convert me interaction

- maybe transform all party members into elves. not just you and Julia

- tutorial gold highlights on What is an Archeologist decision and expedition

- change the "plea for help" event to a better theme than steward, maybe figure out why Aeluran isnt loading

- people think traits are OP, maybe reduce abit

- Old Age Prowess modifier and Infirm trait: see if we can make them dynamic and pushed back based on elf trait level.

- more expedition locations: just make portal components dynamic where they appear

- makes random elf culture spawn with elf

- abdication/handle old extra elves
    - maybe yearly pulse that counts how many unlanded elves there in proportion to landed elves and starts yeeting
    - second starter tradition, aelurans advise you its customary to abdicate and advise from the rear at certain age
    - to compensate the loss of your dynasty and to reward player, renown bonus given for every elf that leaves

- event to move portal to your capital, cost alot of gold or whatever

- reduce elf fertility overall since they live so long

- beauty facial remove?

# The Patch Of The Great Houses
- purify the ancient bloodlines event, the traits get upgraded art and lose all of the negatives
    - Maybe its a decision that is unlocked for true elf characters with that bloodline
    - cost "blessing tokens"
- can collect all the infinity stone traits to form a combined trait
- package this with new dynasty emblems

- event window dlc logo

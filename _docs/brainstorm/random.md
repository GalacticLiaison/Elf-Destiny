 Search textformatting = { in base game

 
 Lembas satchel: item for donors

 some kind of item that makes trials of luck (extra spin?) and greed easier

Something maybe a tradition or artifact, that gives more info about genetic things. Maybe from Aelurans
- example: hovering over the Rut mult-birth would then show a table with odds of each multiple of births

excalibur sword in stone event, need prowess of 50 to pull it
thors hammers need "worthiness" and prowess to equip it

for "choose guild" decision in act 2, maybe it works like

already wrote somewhere but new bloddline event, preg mother who needs shelter, child has two bloodlines 

born in the red version of all the twin traits?

artifact that gives plague resistance, maybe aeluran related

aeluran servant maybe should include a loyalty oath that binds them. Aelurans have additonal control over them

maybe for the dune genetic prophecy traits you find prophecy tablets that unlock them as a possibility?

for quests maybe make a decision that has dynamic localization text based on where along in the quest you are and its disabled till quest complete
- could be useful for genetic prophecies, as yuo find tablets they suddenly appear in your decisions tab

ideas:
- prowess: master sword in the stone, but the zelda master sword in stone in england, the one who pulls it gains an Elven version of the King Of England title.

someone mentioned AGOT has Heterochromia: https://www.reddit.com/r/CK3AGOT/comments/1dju96t/midweek_dev_diary_heterochromia_eyes/
- could use this to handle elves of two eye bloodlines
   - sometime all one, sometimes the other, sometimes one of each


patch random:
- maybe if there are enough unhappy aeluran rulers close together (even across lieges), they band together to form a new kingdom appointing a more worthy male 
- could turn players government into an aeluran servant gov
- event where aeluran sister arrests liege and keeps him/her in their prison!
- make fecund an actual aeluran ability, turn on at will!
- events: game of thrones shame naked walk througn capital, maybe for vassals too
- having the player character lined up in front of a more powerful lord as a marriage option is fire though, maybe player can enhance odds of being chosen!!
- maybe aeluran sisters have little autonomy in their own matchmaking


put pantheon as a section in religion screen and show icons for valar you follow

fowr 
- make each chase segment an event with a variety of skill check options to either get closer or farther from succeeding
- use camera = {} to zoom rabbit out, use it to put in hedge doorway or something and use an image with depth/distance

For Group ritual spells
- add spark users from your realm
- the more users the more powerful/better results
- use wheel of time mechanic, one male caster required for every seven female

loyalty rework ideas
- event that asks how you feel that aelurans have control
   - decide to resist or not to maybe have aelurans gain loyal/disloyal


different intent could lead to different expedition outcomes, maybe knowledge seeking for example

To make the ascended tribal holding requirement make sense maybe we should have it instead require a completely new type of holding. It would be a better tribal holding.
- maybe different versions to choose from!
   - "Tribal Bastion"
   - "Ethereal Grove"
   - "X Sanctuary"
   - "Arbor"
- "one features tree integrated buildings"
   - "maybe need a spark crystal to create?"


An artifact that you can transfer levels of your elf ascension to and it grows stronger.
- could lead to sapiant weapons. maybe telepathically linked to character

plague resistance is used to determine success of spy animals scheme

for direct spark trial use glow effect, use transparent pixels art if needed

maybe we can create an event widget that is just glow orb to absolute position over the emperor's sigil

dynasty legacy "strong blood" or soemthing like that. MAkes it so dynasty never has elf blood, its auto promoted to full elf!

rubble holding type, from destruction

could introduce oracle through a blessing "Astral Affinity"
- art is a couple elves stargazing and pointing

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(utopia)

tradition: divine starfall
   - maybe just for thundaraels
   - obsessed with comets and shooting stars, seek out the metals and magics they bring.

tradition: music based "song keepers" or some such thing, use instruments some how


Make Aeluran advisor either:
   - a voluntary decision

      - all resonances are listed at different "types" of the same activity
      - each resonance type is named after a historic elf
      - art for activity type is their likeness
      - * cool idea, if have the planned spiritual blessing, maybe can bestow the upgraded possessed trait on a character and its this famous elf, so you essentially resurrect them!. Celebrim for example.

 Search textformatting = { in base game

 - one row just has ??? or something like that, get tradition or artifact, a door opens kind of thing.
 - another 1/1000 spin that has symbols not even on the board show up

 some kind of item that makes trials of luck (extra spin?) and greed easier

 A quest line to make the ultimate castle
 - your people stumble upon an enchanted marble deposit

 super long trading quest where you keep trading up items like in legend of zelda ocarina

 uncanny luck tradition: reward for getting best result in luck trial

Something maybe a tradition or artifact, that gives more info about genetic things. Maybe from Aelurans
- example: hovering over the Rut mult-birth would then show a table with odds of each multiple of births

excalibur sword in stone event, need prowess of 50 to pull it
thors hammers need "worthiness" and prowess to equip it

for "choose guild" decision in act 2, maybe it works like
- to unlock the guilds features you need to construct a faction HQ Duchy building

The former elf emperor is going to need backstory eventually
- hist staff has powerful emethyst
- all the evil he did was for a reason, to prevent some great disaster

MAgical Contracts: With COnsequences

See if we can tweak the UI to have single trait icon that rotates bloodlines

   - create new faction type!!!

mythic artifact, hammer that gives insane building speed bonus 

myhtril coat

take the hired mercenary concept from iberian penninsula to the extreme

combine aeluran respect with legitamacy window, just add a second bar!

for the warg spell "send animal spys", use map selector like finding hook, increase range for each magic skill elvel 1-3

form network of spies event/unlockable councilor task

Man just realized even Harry Potter has elves lol, bad ending for elves is they become house elf servants to humans?

some effect that gives a ONE TIME bonus of +1 Dynasty Renown fo each living ruler of your dynasty

already wrote somewhere but new bloddline event, preg mother who needs shelter, child has two bloodlines 

born in the red version of all the twin traits?

artifact that gives plague resistance, maybe aeluran related

aeluran servant maybe should include a loyalty oath that binds them. Aelurans have additonal control over them

maybe for the dune genetic prophecy traits you find prophecy tablets that unlock them as a possibility?

for quests maybe make a decision that has dynamic localization text based on where along in the quest you are and its disabled till quest complete
- could be useful for genetic prophecies, as yuo find tablets they suddenly appear in your decisions tab

cull the weak: haze comes over elves when the pop gets to big and it increases the murdernous in their personalities
- maybe a religious tenet! changes murder doctrine to allowed for awhile: purge

mysterious young refugee arrives and starts slowing gaining control

ideas:
- prowess: master sword in the stone, but the zelda master sword in stone in england, the one who pulls it gains an Elven version of the King Of England title.

someone mentioned AGOT has Heterochromia: https://www.reddit.com/r/CK3AGOT/comments/1dju96t/midweek_dev_diary_heterochromia_eyes/
- could use this to handle elves of two eye bloodlines
   - sometime all one, sometimes the other, sometimes one of each


patch random:
- maybe if there are enough unhappy aeluran rulers close together (even across lieges), they band together to form a new kingdom appointing a more worthy male 
- could turn players government into an aeluran servant gov
- event where aeluran sister arrests liege and keeps him/her in their prison!
- make fecund an actual aeluran ability, turn on at will!
- events: game of thrones shame naked walk througn capital, maybe for vassals too
- having the player character lined up in front of a more powerful lord as a marriage option is fire though, maybe player can enhance odds of being chosen!!
- maybe aeluron sisters have little autonomy in their own matchmaking


put pantheon as a section in religion screen and show icons for valar you follow

fowr 
- make each chase segment an event with a variety of skill check options to either get closer or farther from succeeding
- use camera = {} to zoom rabbit out, use it to put in hedge doorway or something and use an image with depth/distance

For Group ritual spells
- add spark users from your realm
- the more users the more powerful/better results
- use wheel of time mechanic, one male caster required for every seven female

loyalty rework ideas
- event that asks how you feel that aelurans have control
   - decide to resist or not to maybe have aelurans gain loyal/disloyal


diffrerent intent could lead to different expedition outcomes, maybe knowledge seeking for example

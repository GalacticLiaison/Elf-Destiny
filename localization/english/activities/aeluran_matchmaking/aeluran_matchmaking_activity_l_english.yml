  matchmaking_standard_elf_candidate_desc:0 "[candidate.GetName] here is a common Elf without any particular talents or high station. [candidate.GetSheHe|U] is however a loyal elf of the faith and would make a perfectly suitable spouse."

  matchmaking_genetic_good_elf_candidate_desc:0 "[candidate.GetName] is an Elf of good genetic pedigree. A suitable match, no doubt your lineage would be strong of blood for generations to come."

  matchmaking_genetic_great_elf_candidate_desc:0 "[candidate.GetName] is an Elf of remarkable genetic pedigree. A grand match indeed, your lineage would be most impressive."

  matchmaking_aeluran_advisor_candidate_desc:0 "M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I humbly put myself forth as candidate. We already rule this realm side by side; Let us further strengthen that bond with me as your Aeluran Queen."

  matchmaking_aeluran_sister_candidate_desc:0 "An Aeluran Sister is available and The Order would grant you the privilege of wedding such a powerful spouse. [candidate.GetTitledFirstName] is a talented magi, and increasing the influence of The Order in these lands is always welcome. Wouldn't you agree?"
  
  matchmaking_aeluran_matron_candidate_desc:0 "If you would prefer to strengthen your bond with our Order, I have been given the privilege of announcing that our esteemed Matron [candidate.GetTitledFirstName] has offered herself up as candidate. This is quite a rare honour indeed... A spouse so powerful and wise at your side would raise the standing of both you and The Aeluran Order in these lands."

  matchmaking_aeluran_matriarch_candidate_desc:0 "M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] it is with the greatest pleasure that I inform you that High Matriarch [candidate.GetTitledFirstName] has sent me notice. She would do you the highest honor of offering herself as candidate! There is would be no other spouse as wise and powerful in this realm as her, truly a match without equal! The fate of your Dynasty would be bound to the Aeluran Order!"

  matchmaking_genetic_project_candidate_desc:0 "As you know, my order continually seeks to elevate the Elven races through the pursuit of prophetic genetic excellence. To that end, on occasion we may experiment with the lineage of our flock in an attempt to forge new bloodlines. [candidate.GetName] here is example of such experimentation. If you can see past superficial abnormalities you will find this union offers great genetic potential for your line!"

  matchmaking_family_candidate_desc:0 "Let us not forget your own house, a closer match would no doubt maintain or even enhance the purity of your bloodline."

  matchmaking_bloodline_trait_candidate_desc:0 "You are quite fortunate indeed M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]. [candidate.GetName] is descendant of one of the great Elven Dynasties and their House's Bloodline resonates strongly within [candidate.GetHerHim]. This union could add great power to your line!"

  matchmaking_warrior_candidate_desc:0 "A sister from one of our most remote tribes made the Order aware of this specimen. [candidate.GetName] is a fine warrior and quite genetically gifted. Your union would no doubt bring great strength and honor to your line."

  matchmaking_wisemen_candidate_desc:0 "If wise council in a partner is what you seek most look no further than [candidate.GetName]. [candidate.GetSheHe|U] is quite learned and a gifted healer as well. This union could help seed your line with great minds for generations to come."

  matchmaking_imprisoned_rogue_candidate_desc:0 "I hesitate to even suggest this one as a candidate, but locked up in my dungeon's cells is [candidate.GetName]. [candidate.GetSheHe|U] is a rogue and a sinner who puts [candidate.GetHerHis] pursuits of pleasure before all else. However, I will admit that [candidate.GetHerHis] intimate knowledge of the criminal underworld would make [candidate.GetHerHim] a capable and formidable [spymaster|E]."

  matchmaking_shy_scholar_candidate_desc:0 "Getting [candidate.GetHerHim] to come here to be presented took some serious coaxing from the sisters of my order. Freshly plucked from [candidate.GetHerHis] tower we have [candidate.GetName]. [candidate.GetSheHe|U] is intensely shy, debilitatingly so. However in [candidate.GetHerHis] solitude [candidate.GetSheHe] has lived a life of great academic achievement. If you are looking for a suitor of great learning to help better educate your court, look no further."

  matchmaking_bastard_claimant_candidate_desc:0 "[candidate.GetName] came to our order seeking protection from their vile Human lord father. [candidate.GetSheHe|U] is a [GetTrait('bastard').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] and only of [GetTrait('elf_blood').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] true. However with a righteous claim to [candidate.GetHerHis] father's title, this union could give you an opportunity to expand your realm"

  matchmaking_inferior_dowry_candidate_desc:0 "Normally we wouldn't pay mind to a match petitioner of such little Elven grace. However [candidate.GetName] has made a generous donation to our Order and has offered to provide you a dowry for this match as well. A fiscally pragmatic option I must say"

  matchmaking_foreign_elf_candidate_desc:0 "[candidate.GetName] here is an adventurer from a distant land and quite the experienced traveler. [candidate.GetHerHis|U] ways be be foreign and strange, but this union could help introduce new ways of thinking into your realm."

  matchmaking_twins_candidate_desc:0 "You're seen as a ruler of high value to The Order, and so we wish to bestow you with a suitable union. These two maidens are twins blessed by the spark. They are both of great stock and trained in the ways of the magi. A rare and worthy match!"

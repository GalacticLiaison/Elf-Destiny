  expedition.00512.desc:0 "Upon entering a grand chamber, you spot a statue of fine white marble directly across from you. It depicts a fine Elf Maiden, overlooking what appears to be a game board. You notice some carvings of a variety of figures embedded into the tiles; it seems as though you need to play a game of some sort in order to pass this trial. \nAs you take a step forward, the maiden's sudden movement causes you to jump back. She flashes you a pretty smile that conveys a clear message; #warning Your Move#! \n\n"

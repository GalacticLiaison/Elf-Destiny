I am the head of a minor long forgotten house. I am writing to you with great sorrow, for my healers tell me I am not long for this world.\n\nThis child, my [orphan.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], is all I have left. [orphan.GetHerHis] father died long ago, and [orphan.GetSheHe] has no one else. [orphan.GetTitledFirstName] is the last of our dynasty and should be raised in a proper noble Elf house.

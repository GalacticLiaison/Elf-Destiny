As you wearily climb out of your bed trying to clear your head, your servant explains the situation; Sisters of the Aeluran Order, known as the red witches by the common folk, have somehow learnt of your latest expedition and are demanding your presence."
    aeluran_story.001.ok:0 "I'll hear them in my council chambers. Send them in."

    aeluran_story.002.desc:0 "You enter the council room to find two Aeluran Sisters awaiting your arrival. Their embroidered dresses and ageless beauty render you speechless for a moment, your consternation only interrupted by the apparent junior of the two clearing her throat. \n\n\"M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], my name is [aeluran_matron.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. You have been granted the privilege of standing before Mistress [high_matriarch.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], High Matriach of the Aeluran Weavers.\" \n\nOn cue, the other sister steps forward to meet your eyes, moving with an effortless grace, her youthful face somehow projecting wisdom and sagacity. \n\n\"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], I know our arrival is unexpected, but we come to discuss a matter of great importance. I felt the release of divine energy a short time ago, and finding you, an elf in human lands, confirms my suspicions. I know you have found the Sigil of the Realm Lord.\""
    aeluran_story.002.ok:0 "How do you know of this?"

    aeluran_story.003.title:1 "Crimson Visitors"
    aeluran_story.003.desc:0 "\"I am not here to take it from you.\" The Matriarch continues, her song-like voice drawing you closer. \"The sigil only reacts to those it finds worthy. Possessing it marks you as the undisputed #bold Elf Lord #!of this world.\" Upon seeing the stunned expression on your face, the younger of the sisters audibly sighs, prompting a hard glare from the Matriarch. \n\n\"In ancient times, Elves and Humans came to this world through a great portal. Countless empires have risen to unimaginable heights and fallen to mere dust since. At one point, the very Elf Emperor's tomb, whom's sigil you found, was overthrown in a massive rebellion.\" \n\n\"Most Elves were either slain or forced to flee back through the portal, leaving this world behind. A small population did remain, sticking to the far wilds where they could live in peace. After the Great Exodus, vital components of the portal were destroyed by the rebels, and our gateway to the other realms was lost.\" \n\n\"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], the sigil choosing you at this time is no coincidence. It is confirmation that the Divine Spark, the great creator of all things, is making its will known. It is time to restore the Grand Portal and welcome the great Elven people back to this world!\""
    aeluran_story.003.ok:0 "A momentous and worthy undertaking!"

    aeluran_story.004.desc:0 "\"It is indeed! You will need to find replacements for the destroyed portal components. I have learned such things were rare, yet still available in the days of old. You must continue your expeditions of ancient Elven sites and find the parts we need.\" She finishes, motioning the younger sister to lay a map out on the table. \"We have brought maps with us; They detail some newly discovered Elven ruins for you to investigate.\" [high_matriarch.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] looks deep into your eyes. \"The world's fate lies in your hands. I do not say that lightly."\n\n\"Before we make the long journey back to our sanctum in the North, I have one additional matter to discuss with you. It is customary of all Elven Lords across all realms to accept the Divine Spark as the true guiding force of the universe. Furthermore, the Sisters of The Aeluran Weavers are seen as the shepherds of its will. I implore you to accept The Order into your lands, to advise and further the interests of the Divine Spark.\" "

She claims that she is a trained 'archeologist', but I am fairly sure that she's made that term up.\" You both glance over as the self-proclaimed expert knocks over a vase. \n\n\Your steward shakes their head and continues. \"She has apparently found a great discovery relating to the 'Elves'. As far as I'm concerned they're nothing more than a children's fairytale, but seeing as how insistent she was, I thought it best to bring her to you. What shall I tell her?\""

  elf_destiny_main_story_events.001.desc:0 "The young woman scampers over to you as your steward waves her over, fiery red hair trailing behind her. \n\n\"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]," She says in between puffs of breath, clearly exhausted from her journey. \"I am Julia Melwood, one of the best archeologists in my field, if I may be so bold.\" \n\nYou spare a look at your steward, who is clearly not impressed. The young woman seems to have brought some bundles of rolled parchments along with her, lying them flat on the table and pointing to various points on the map. You notice some strange script lining the borders, perhaps some dialect of Arabic? \n\n\"I strive to discover clues our ancestors left behind, and my specialty is the study of the mysterious Elven people. Very little is known of them, and it is incredibly difficult to find any evidence of their existence. What small artifacts have been found tell us that they were a highly advanced civilization, perhaps even more so than ourselves, and seem to have survived for hundreds, or perhaps even #EMP thousands #!of years.\" \n\n\"I recently came across this map. It's covered in an elven script that I can't decipher, but it appears to show the location of an old fortress high in the Alpine mountains.\" \n\n\She looks up from the parchments and you can't help but notice the excitement in her eyes. The aforementioned fortress lies in modern day  \n\n\"Opportunities to study the elves come few and far between, and if the fortress does exist, it may contain great treasures forgotten to time. I would like to mount an expedition to investigate these ruins, but I am in need of funding to supply such a long trek. Will you help me?\""

It's the same feeling you had when you grabbed that amulet in the Elven tomb... It does not say anything to you, but instead projects a single idea into your mind. \n\n #bold \"See.\" #! \n\n And you do;  Thousands of lifetimes flash before your eyes, threatening to overwhelm your every sense. Great wars between humans and elves, vast empires built upon the backs of Human slaves, but also grand feasts shared in friendship between Human and Elf Kings. You begin to understand the intention of the presence as it conveys another idea. \n\n #bold \"Choose.\"  #!"

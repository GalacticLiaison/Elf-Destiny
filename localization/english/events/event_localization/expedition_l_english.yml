  # Find Sigil Of The Realm Lord
  expedition.0069.title:0 "A Kingly Tomb"
  expedition.0069.desc:0 "You come upon a large chamber, perhaps once used as a grand hall by Lords of old. Large pillars line the room, holding up a majestic ceiling that stretches high above you. In the center of the room sits a long dead King; his throne his final resting place. \"What a discovery!\" Julia shouts, scampering over to inspect the corpse. \"Look at this!\" she says, points at a radiant amulet hanging around the King's neck. You feel a strange pull towards the gem, and have to fight the urge to draw closer. \"Well M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]?\" says a gleaming Julia. \"What are you waiting for?\"
  expedition.0069.ok:0 "Reach out and grab the gem..."

  expedition.00691.title:0 "A Powerful Presence"
  expedition.00691.desc:0 "Upon touching the gem a brilliant blinding light envelopes you and Julia. Suddenly you're lost, feeling like a row boat caught in a raging hurricane, your only solace being the knowledge that #bold you are not alone #!. It isn't Julia, you realise. No... It is a vast and incomprehensible presence that dwarfs you, the tomb, and the planet you reside on. It both comforts and terrifies you, shielding you from the light while examining every fibre of your being with a piercing gaze. \n\nThe experience elevates your senses, allowing you to examine your body in a way that you never could before. You feel your heart beat, your lungs breathe, your blood flow, and your mind think. You feel your body as a whole and witness your soul tremble."
  expedition.00691.ok:0 "Is this... death?"

  expedition.00692.title:0 "Visions of a Past Long Gone"
  expedition.00692.desc:0 "Amidst the blinding lights, the presence fills your mind's eye with images of the past. You see how the great Elves of old lived, and are filled with the plethora of emotions they felt. You know you could keep pulling on this thread and adopt their hopes and beliefs as your own.\n\n Do you convert to the Elf culture and start a fresh slate, or do you continue to evolve your current culture?"
  expedition.00692.convert:0 "I will take the Elf culture as my own."
  expedition.00692.dontConvert:0 "I will shape the New Elvish people from the culture I have."

  expedition.00693.title:0 "A Surprising Transformation"
  expedition.00693.desc:0 "The light eventually fades and the world comes back into focus. You feel different. Looking at Julia, your eyes widen at her newly elongated ears. Upon seeing her own shocked face, you reach up and feel the tips of your pointy ears with your fingers. \n\n\"M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], it looks like we've been transformed into elves! Like the legendary people of old! I need to write down what I saw somewhere...\" She says hurriedly, scampering off to find something to write on. \n\nYou look at the gem still clutched in your hand in wonder. What does this change mean for you and your people...?"
  expedition.00693.ok:0 "We should head home and reflect on this."

  expedition.006901.desc:0 "A massive stone door stands in your way. Engraved with ancient runes and lined with silver accents, it possesses a level of craftsmanship that most artisans would struggle to replicate. Julia runs her finger over the ancient writing, muttering to herself and scribbling in her notebook.\n\nAfter a few minutes, she finally looks up at you. \"M'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], I believe it to be a riddle left by the elves. It's clear that we must solve it to proceed further.\""
  expedition.006901.ok:0 "Very well, what does it say?"

  # Expedition Has Ended
  expedition.006.title:0 "Expedition has finished"
  expedition.006.desc:0 "Your supplies have run low enough to warrant a return home. While you might leave with incalculable luxuries, you can't deny that perhaps the most important things gained from this expedition were both the knowledge you gained of the Elves, and the questions they have raised."
  expedition.006.ok:0 "It's time to head home."

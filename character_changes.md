# Character Changes

**NOTE: Spoilers for both Elf Destiny and Witchcraft, as well as this mod**

## Context
I tried to balance the lores of both universes when making these changes. However, it's not perfect due to URF limitations. An eventual stretch goal is to add traits that better describe the origins of story-relevant characters, but this is likely to be far off.

## Changes to Old Characters

### Characters who are Now Otherworlders
- Most Demons
- Non-Sentient Characters (golem, blob)
- Abdul al Hazred- Figured this was the best race to give him given he's kinda-sorta human

### Characters who now have Elf Blood
- Baba Yaga
- Baba Yaga's daugther (chance to be Human, Elf Blood, or Elf)
- Merlin (this is canon to Arthurian legend)

### Characters who are Now Elves
- Pandora (She's still a demon, though.)

### Characters who are now Maia
- Lilith (She's still a demon. Now has the Enchantress and Passionate traits.)

### Characters who have changed so much they neeed their own section
Hecate has had *major* changes. As the goddess of magic in Greek myth, I thought it was only appropriate to give her increased magic abilities. So, Hecate is an Aratar with a twist. She has the Warped Spark trait, Warped Body trait, and Warped Mind trait, along with all Magic and Spark lifestyle traits.

## New Characters

### Otherworlders
- Kalfu (Traits: Man in Red, The Guide, all spark traits)
- Freda (Traits: Woman in Rose, The Guide, all magic traits)

### Fae Characters
- Nimue (Max Beauty trait, Benevolent trait)
- Morgana (Max Beauty trait, Covetous trait)

Fix character window

Aeluran vassal contracts are totally messed up. Look into converting common/vassal_contracts => common/subject_contracts

test if aeluran county conversion is causing aelurans to leave, may be related to auto-convert submod
create documentation on all thigns othat have been overwritten to better help patch updates
sync birth_events with base game updates


Ideas to improve magi reinforcements,
- maybe have player start a war, give troops, then auto-end
- attempt to create a special aeluran title that has title troops? (think it must be landed though...)

# Elf Destiny: Spark Within

This is the (semi-) official repository for Elf Destiny: Spark Within. This submod of Elf Destiny combines it with the Witchcraft mod to allow elves to use magic, as well as provide mid- and end-game challenges.

This mod is developed by **ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh** (yes, that many h's) on the Elf Destiny Discord [Server](https://discord.gg/fyuPcf5HFZ).


## Features

### New Lifestyles
Chose from two new lifestyles: Witchcraft and Sparkcraft. Witchcraft allows you to curse you enemies, while Spark can help you enrich your kingdom. Of course, you can always use both...

Unlike vanilla lifestyles, these new lifestyles will only appear if you have the correct traits, and advanced perks may require additional conditions to be met.


### New Characters

Some new characters have been added with a variety of Magic/Spark traits. In the future, they will all have their own storylines and serve as powerful in-game foes. Current storylines include:

-  **Kalfu and Freda**: Two strange Srcanists roam the deserts of Western Africa. They can grant you powerful Spark and Magic abilities, and even help you to ascend in your elfdom, but at a terrible cost.
- **Nimue and Morgana**: Two powerful Fae who wish to meddle with your plans. Do too well, and the jealous Morgana will attack and scheme against your kingdom. Mistreat your subjects, and Nimue will empower great heroes to fight against you.

### Elves are Magical (literally)
Even if you aren't a witch, elves can access the first lifestyle tree of the Witchcraft lifestyle. Higher levels of elfdom will further increase your magic and spark potential.

Elves also can gain access to higher spells more easily. However, they are much more easily detected by Hunters...so be careful!


## What's Changed?

### Terminology Streamlining
If you use Witchcraft and Elf Destiny seperately, you've seen that both mods use many similar terms and concepts. These terms have been changed and diaglogue has been rewritten so that Spark Wielders and Magic Users have similar, but different practices.

Spark Wielders and Magic Users are now both Arcanists. In general, Spark is the domain of the elves and Magic is the domain of the humans, but a very blessed human might wield Spark and an elf might decide to become an excellent magic user.

Like the vanilla Elf Destiny mod, women are generally better at wielding Spark- the Magi trait now provides a boost to magic power and the ability to access higher levels of magic. However, there are rumors that certain men rebel against this tradition...

### Characters
To accomodate for Elf Destiny's lore, some characters have been changed to be Otherworlders or Elves. See the [Character Updates](character_changes.md) page for a full list of changes.

### Balance

Because Elf Destiny makes the game far easier, the diffulculty of Witchcraft mod elements has been increased. Hunter activity is increased. Vanilla and Witchcraft's traits and perks are balanced so that human Arcanists don't get steamrolled immeadiately given higher tier elves are OP.
- Hunters are a bit stronger than before, and now have tiers.
- Demons are now a lot stronger. Major demons can stand toe-to-toe with a high-tier elf.
- Mortals now have a buff that helps them evade Hunters for longer.
- Mortals now have mortal-specific magic traits elves cannot access.
- Magic traits from the Witchcraft mod have more buffs.
- Otherworlders are more friendly to mortals than immortals.

Obviously, this mod wouldn't exist without these two, but they've also been lovely about me smashing these huge mods together.

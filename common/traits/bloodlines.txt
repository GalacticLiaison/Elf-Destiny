# IDEA: MAYBE USE AI TO CREATE GEM BLOOD DROPS FOR ICONS
# IDEA: If to0 many similar affects on traits, bundle them into a modifer effect or something

# Huge Idea: create a very special event where you can forge a new dynasty bloodline trait
#  - options could be based on 
#    - your current blood traits
#    - your acheivements
#  - this is similar to the final combine all blood line...
#    - if you wait for this event until you have the "final" bloodline, special options for new bloodline
#  - customization options 
#	 - player can pick among blood trait icons

# Tutorial on Ancient Bloodlines starts in phase 2 with higher ranked aelurin weaver coming through portal
# Do i get reeeaaal ambitious and do three levels of each
#  - Inheritance: to upgrade a level, need to find someone with higher level, otherwise 2% chance of upgrading
#		- Both same level: 100% of basic inheritance, 2% chance of upgrading
#		- One with level higher: 70% chance of lower level, 30% chance of higher level, 0% chance of upgrading

# THOUGHTS
# - I think by default dynasty should be candidates...

# 6 total
# 	3 automatic
# 	3 elective
# or maybe just do electives....

# maybe a spouse based elective... like spouses get a higher score

# ELECTIONS
# Elven Dynastic Succesion
	# Candidates
	# 	- all House members

	# Candidate Strength
	# 	- elf quality
	# 	- title strength

	# Electors
	# 	- all elf vassals
	# 	- aeluran advisor
	# 	- player

	# Elector Strength
	# 	- Elf quality
